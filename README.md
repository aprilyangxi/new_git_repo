# the description of the project

specify a topic：how to protect all digital research data（maybe I'll change this）
provide some context for the topic: remain to collect next week
research question: as we all know, data can be easily lost for many reasons. We don't know how many of this data belonged to the Humanities and we don't know how many important data that has been lost alreday. I have two reseaech questions. The first one is that is there a specific method to protect all digital research data? The second question is that even if the data is not lost, does the available data useful?
mention tools and methods that i could use: remain to make sure
